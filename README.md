## Overview

**Onze Coffee** is a Flutter app designed to offer an easy and efficient way for users to order and track their coffee orders. It employs the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for managing state, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience. The app provides user authentication and order management capabilities, with the following features:

## Key Features

- **Onboarding**: A guided experience that introduces new users to the app's features.
- **Authentication**: Secure user login and email verification through OTP (One Time Password).
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time order tracking, showing the status of the coffee order in progress.
- **Order Management**: Allows users to view their current and completed orders with a clear interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is built to adjust dynamically across different screen sizes and orientations for an optimal user experience.

### User Flow
The user flow diagram illustrates the process of managing orders for both employees and customers in an ordering system. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Start**
   - The process begins for either an employee or a customer.

### 2. **Employee Decision**
   - **If the user is an employee** (left side - red flow):
     - They are directed to **check orders**.
     - **Decision Point (Accept?)**:
       - If the order is **accepted**, the employee proceeds to **confirm the order**.
       - After confirming, they can **change the order state** to reflect the status.
     - If the order is **not accepted**, the flow terminates.

   - **If the user is not an employee** (right side - blue flow):
     - They are directed to **view products** available in the system.

### 3. **Customer Flow**
   - **Add to Cart**: The customer selects products and adds them to the cart.
   - **Place Order**: The customer proceeds to place the order.
   - **View Order and Waiting Time**: The customer views the order details and estimated waiting time.
   - **Decision Point (Proceed?)**:
     - If the customer decides to proceed, they go to **Payment**.
     - After payment, the customer can **track the order**.

### 4. **End**
   - The process concludes once the employee has processed the order or the customer has successfully placed and tracked their order.
